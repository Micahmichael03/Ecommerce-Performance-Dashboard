# E-commerce Performance Dashboard

## Description
This project features a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze e-commerce sales data from the [Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail) provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dashboard tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue ($6.49M), average order value ($475.72), and number of orders (14K). I customized it with additional visuals, including a customer district table and an order quantity donut chart, to provide deeper insights into customer behavior and sales patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset contains transactional data from a UK-based online retailer, covering December 2010 to December 2011. It includes details like invoice numbers, product codes, quantities, prices, customer IDs, and countries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- MySQL
- Power BI Desktop
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `mysql-connector-python`, `ucimlrepo`

## Setup
1. **Database Setup:**
   - Install MySQL and create a database named `ecommerce_db`.
   - Run the SQL script `create_table.sql` to create the `online_retail` table:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;
     USE ecommerce_db;
     CREATE TABLE online_retail (
         InvoiceNo VARCHAR(10),
         StockCode VARCHAR(20),
         Description TEXT,
         Quantity INT,
         InvoiceDate DATETIME,
         UnitPrice DECIMAL(10,2),
         CustomerID INT,
         Country VARCHAR(50),
         TotalPrice DECIMAL(10,2)
     );
     ```

2. **Data Loading:**
   - Run the ETL script to extract, transform, and load the data into MySQL:
     ```bash
     python etl_script.py
     ```

3. **Power BI:**
   - Open the `ecommerce_dashboard.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
   - Connect the data source to your MySQL database (`localhost`, `ecommerce_db`).

## Dashboard Features
- **Key Metrics:** Count of records (278.51K), number of orders (14K), average order value ($475.72), total revenue ($6.49M), total unit price ($879.56K), and quantity by distinct (266).
- **Revenue Trend Over Time:** Line chart showing quarterly revenue from Q4 2010 to Q4 2011.
- **Top Products by Revenue:** Horizontal bar chart highlighting top products like “Emergency CA” and various bike models.
- **CustomerID by District:** Custom table listing customers, their districts, and revenue (e.g., District 1 customers with $80-90 revenue).
- **Number of Orders by Year:** Pie chart comparing order volumes between 2010 and 2011.
- **Sales by Region:** Geographical map showing sales distribution across North America, Europe, Asia, and more.
- **Total Orders of Quantity:** Donut chart illustrating the distribution of order quantities.

## Insights
- Revenue peaked in Q2 2011, possibly due to seasonal demand or promotional campaigns.
- Products like “Emergency CA” and bikes are major revenue drivers, suggesting a focus on outdoor or sports equipment.
- The customer district table identifies high-value customers and regions for targeted marketing.
- The sales map reveals a diverse international customer base, useful for global expansion strategies.
This project also demonstrates key data engineering skills such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), data collection, and data cleaning, which were essential steps in preparing the dataset and building the dashboard.
